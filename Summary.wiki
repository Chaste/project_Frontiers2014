Welcome to the Chaste wiki.

This section contains pages generated automatically from the source code accompanying "Cellular cardiac electrophysiology modelling with Chaste and CellML", our paper in Frontiers in Physiology.

Before running these examples you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.3].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
Note that Chaste is only supported on Linux/Unix systems, so users of Windows or Mac OS X will need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

The paper is organised around examples that are annotated and explained here.
Before looking at these, you may wish to look at some of the [UserTutorials basic user tutorials].

== Cellular electrophysiology benchmarks ==

The steps required to reproduce the study are:
 1. Generate accurate reference traces and calculate an acceptable level of error for each model ([wiki:PaperTutorials/Frontiers2014/GeneratingReferenceData Generating reference data])
 1. Work out the timesteps for each numerical method that are required to meet this error tolerance ([wiki:PaperTutorials/Frontiers2014/CalculateRequiredTimesteps Calculate Required Timesteps])
 1. Benchmark solvers with these timesteps ([wiki:PaperTutorials/Frontiers2014/OdeSolvingTimes Time solvers])
 
For (1 & 2) see the code in PaperTutorials/Frontiers2014/GeneratingReferenceData. For
